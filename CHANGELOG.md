# Changelog

All notable changes to photonoxide are documented in this file, generated from the pull request titles by [release-plz](https://release-plz.dev/).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and photonoxide adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2026-10-03

### <!-- 4 -->Documentation

- 0.4.0 is released, and 0.4.1's preconditioner is next ([#93](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/93))

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/compare/v0.3.3...v0.4.0) - 2026-10-03

### Breaking

- `ParametricModel::fit` takes an `Interpolation` in place of the polynomial degree: `Interpolation::Polynomial { degree }` for the previous fit, `Interpolation::PiecewiseLinear` for Triverio's ([#86](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/86))
- 2D FDFD ports: with H along z, S's reflections are the tangential E's, as the 3D ports' and mode expansions', and so minus those before 0.4.0; a mode's backward amplitude follows ([#90](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/90))
- `Boundaries3d` has a new public field, `real_stretch`: struct literals need it, or `..Boundaries3d::pml(cells)` ([#84](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/84))

### <!-- 0 -->Added

- components and netlists, the foundation of circuits ([#71](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/71))
- the circuit solve: one sparse system per netlist, checked against Filipsson's sub-network growth ([#74](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/74))
- read and write Touchstone files, Version 1 and 2.0 ([#72](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/72))
- the circuit adjoint: every parameter's gradient from one transposed solve ([#75](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/75))
- optimization at circuit level through genoxide: a splitter, a ring at critical coupling and a fit ([#76](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/76))
- compact models by vector fitting, over parameters, and the measured fidelity ([#78](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/78))
- 3D FDFD ports: the grid's own full-vector port modes, one-way mode sources and a reciprocal S-matrix ([#77](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/77))
- the first components: waveguide, bend, couplers, MMI, Y-branch, rings and MZI ([#79](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/79))
- *(studio)* a component library and a chip view ([#80](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/80))
- validate against measured Mach-Zehnder interferometers (Dwivedi 2015) ([#85](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/85))
- *(material)* AlN's index (Rigler 2015), AlGaN films (Rigler 2013), and InGaP beyond Tanaka's range (Ferrini 2002) ([#87](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/87))
- [**breaking**] compact models checked against their papers: Triverio's piecewise-linear model with an exact uniform stability test ([#86](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/86))
- [**breaking**] QMR preconditioned by ILU(0) on Shin and Fan's operator, with PMLs stretched as much as they absorb ([#84](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/84))

### <!-- 1 -->Fixed

- a 3D direct solve reaches round-off on any machine, finishing by QMR on an inaccurate factorization ([#82](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/82))
- 0.4 follow-ups: MMI port polarization, provenance -0.000, parallel spectra, roadmap ([#83](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/83))
- [**breaking**] 2D reflections with H along z by the tangential E's convention, as the 3D ports' ([#90](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/90))

### <!-- 4 -->Documentation

- bring the README up to date with 0.3.3 and the 0.4 work on main ([#88](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/88))
- bring the site, getting started, the studio's README and AGENTS.md up to date ([#89](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/89))
- animate the studio in the README, recorded by a script ([#91](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/91))
- describe the crate as 0.4.0 has it, with FDTD, inverse design, layout and PDKs as planned ([#92](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/92))

## [0.3.3](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3) - 2026-10-03

### <!-- 0 -->Added

- the selected mode travels along its guide in the 3D viewer, and job previews show a modes job whole ([#61](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/61))
- *(validation)* the cases' math as LaTeX, rendered by KaTeX in the studio and on the site ([#62](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/62))
- flip through a sweep's points in the viewer, each with its structure and its modes ([#67](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/67))

### <!-- 1 -->Fixed

- *(studio)* a release in the making is announced as on its way, not as an error ([#58](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/58))
- the check refuses windows that run backwards, a step that isn't positive and sweeps a run can't take; a width sweep's point shows its own cross-section ([#68](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/68))
- new run events go after the old ones, so their discriminants keep their values ([#69](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/69))

### <!-- 4 -->Documentation

- method write-ups' math as GitHub renders it ([#63](https://github.com/tachsin/photonoxide/pull/63))
